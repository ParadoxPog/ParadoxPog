I'm Paradox, a 17 year old dev.
I've used several languages, being:
 - c# (primary language)
 - html/vss
 - javascript
 - java
 - python
  
I'm currently working w/ @Brightrusher on an open world fantasy dungeon crawler game using c# in unity.

the most complete program i've written was a fully functional snap game in java ðŸ˜­
